    The equations on the left are the standard kinematic equations; they express motion of constant acceleration on a straight line.
    The equations on the right are adapted to express motion on a parabola.
    Projectile motion can be defined as follows:
    An object is launched with initial velocity $\vv{v}_{0}$.
    Horizontal acceleration is zero, and vertical acceleration is $-g$, the downward force of gravity.
    $\theta_0$ is the initial launch angle with respect to the positive $x$-axis.

    The path trajectory of a projectile is parabolic and can be expressed as
    \[
        y=\left(\tan\theta_0\right)x-\frac{gx^2}{2\left(v_0\cos\theta_0\right)^2}
    \]

    \smallskip\noindent
    If $x_0 = y_0 = 0$, the object's horizontal range $R$ can be expressed as
    \[
        R = \frac{v_0^2}{g}\sin2\theta_0
    \]

    A frame of reference is an arbitrary set of coordinate axes about which we make measurements.
    A passenger on a train is not moving relative to their seat, but they may be moving very quickly from the perspective of a tree next to the train tracks.
    Given two frames of reference, A and B, with constant velocity; the velocity of a particle P with respect to A is equal to the velocity P with respect to B, plus the velocity of B with respect to A .
    \@.   \[
              \vv{v}_{\text{PA}} = \vv{v}_{\text{PB}} + \vv{v}_{\text{BA}}
    \]

    \smallskip\noindent
    The acceleration is equal from either frame of reference.
    \[
        \vv{a}_{\text{PA}} = \vv{a}_{\text{PB}}
    \]

        First Law:

        & $\vv{F}_{\text{net}} = 0 \rightarrow \vv{a}=0$ \\
        Second Law:
        & The net force $\vv{F}_{\text{net}}$ on a body is the product of its mass $m$ and its acceleration $\vv{a}$.
        &$\vv{F}_{\text{net}} = m\vv{a}$\\
        Third Law:
        & Equal and opposite reactions.

    \subsubsection*{Friction}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Friction}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \rule{\linewidth}{.1mm}

    \smallskip\noindent
    The force of static friction $\vv{f}_s$ has a maximum value $f_{s\text{, max}}$ given by
    \[
        f_{s\text{, max}} = \mu_s F_N
    \]

    \smallskip\noindent
    where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction and $F_N$ is the magnitude of the normal force.
    If the component of $\vv{F}$ parallel to the surface exceeds $f_{s\text{, max}}$, the body will begin to slide.
    Once the body begins to slide on the surface, the frictional force decreases to a constant value $f_k$ given by
    \[
        f_k=\mu_k F_N
    \]

    \smallskip\noindent
    where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
    Kinetic friction is less forceful than static friction.

    \subsubsection*{Drag Force}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Drag Force}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \rule{\linewidth}{.1mm}

    \smallskip\noindent
    A body that is moving relative to a surrounding fluid experiences a drag force $\vv{D}$.
    The force points in the direction in which the fluid flows relative to the body, i.e., opposite of the body's motion relative to the fluid.
    The magnitude of $\vv{D}$ can be expressed as
    \[
        D=\tfrac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2
    \]

    \vspace{.2em}
    \smallskip\noindent
    where $C$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho$ is the fluid density, and $A$ is the effective cross-sectional area of the body, and $v$ is the relative speed.

    \subsubsection*{Terminal Speed}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Terminal Speed}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \rule{\linewidth}{.1mm}

    \smallskip\noindent
    As an object in free fall builds speed, there comes a point where the magnitude of the drag force ${D}$ becomes equal to that of the force of gravity $F_g$.
    The object cannot fall any faster and is said to have reached terminal velocity $v_t$ expressed as
    \[
        v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2F_g}{C\rho A}}
    \]

    \subsubsection*{Uniform Circular Motion}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Uniform Circular Motion}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \rule{\linewidth}{.1mm}

    \smallskip\noindent
    An object traveling along a circle of radius $R$ at constant speed $v$ is said to be in uniform circular motion.
    Speed is constant, therefore acceleration is constant.
    The constant magnitude of acceleration $\vv{a}$ can be expressed as
    \[
        a=\frac{v^2}{R} \quad \text{and} \quad F_c=\frac{mv^2}{R}
    \]

    \smallskip\noindent
    Where $F_c$ is the magnitude of the centripetal force.
    Acceleration $\vv{a}$ and force $\vv{F_c}$ are always directed toward the center of the circle.
    This is what it means for a force to be centripetal; it is directed toward a center around which an object is moving.

    \medskip\noindent
    The time for the object to complete the circle is
    \[
        T = \frac{2\pi R}{v}
    \]
