## Academic Notes Repository

This is a collection of (hopefully) well-formatted notes covering various subjects. I made these
documents as review material for my courses and to have a quick reference for the future. They may
also be helpful to others, so here they are. Feel free to download and share the PDFs or modify the LaTeX source.

Each directory contains the relevant LaTeX source. The pdf's can be previewed and downloaded
from [https://de-manzanares.github.io/Ref-Sheets/](https://de-manzanares.github.io/Ref-Sheets/) or from the links below.
